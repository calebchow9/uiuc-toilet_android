## Features
* MapView using Google Maps SDK to display markers based on user current location with information about the map.
* Add bathrooms into the database at the current user location.
* RecyclerView list with the closest 20 bathrooms to the users current location, updating.
* Options to customize the nearby list by hiding bathrooms, or creating a new favorites list.
* Rating and comment system for each bathroom, with the option to add feedback.

## To-do
* Settings feature to sort list and markers by gender, rating, etc.
* Create custom marker textboxes to display additional information.

## Notes
Information is stored using a REST API into a MongoDB database. No user information is collected, simply the resources needed to display bathroom information. API is hosted on heroku at: https://uiuc-toilet.herokuapp.com
